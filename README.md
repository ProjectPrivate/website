A website using HTML 5 and CSS collaboratively to create a web page dedicated to the files of ProjectPrivate.

Any and all major updates will be recorded here prior to being pulled to main. Keep in mind that not all ideas will be approved and that there will be constant development of the files in this repository and each of its branches.
